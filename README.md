# sumanalarm

A simple, fun, and competitive alarm clock to help you enjoy getting out of bed in the morning. Alarm only turns off after
getting close enough to your gimbal beacon.  Time yourself each morning, and see how you did. Race against your friends for a
friendly and fun way to get up in the morning.  Nothing gets you out of bed like a good competition.
